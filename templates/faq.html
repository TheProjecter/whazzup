<h1>What's up &mdash; FAQ</h1>

<h2>Why are there [No title] feeds in my feed list?</h2>

<p>If you've just added feeds, it's probably because the background
  queue hasn't gotten around to processing them yet.

<p>If the feed is red it's because the feed couldn't be loaded. The
  reason could be that the URL is wrong, or something else. Click on
  the feed to see the error message.

<p>If none of the above explain the problem,
  <a href="mailto:larsga@garshol.priv.no">send me an email</a> and
  I'll have a look.

<h2>Why isn't my question here?</h2>

<p>Because nobody's asked it yet. Send an email to
  <a href="mailto:larsga@garshol.priv.no">me</a>, and I'll try to help.
